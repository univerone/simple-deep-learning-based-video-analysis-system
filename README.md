A simple video analysis system for coding test

## updates

### 2020-10-26

Add video processing part (Thanks to  [opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) and [pretrained caffe dnn model](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/FaceDetectionComparison/models/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel))
Add html video preview part(Thanks to [video.js](https://videojs.com/))


## 1. Introduction
Flask + sqlLite + Celery + Rabbitmq

This is a simple video analysis system with both front-end and  back-end.

In the front-end, user can upload their video(only support .mp4, .flv, .mkv within 50MB). 

After submitting the video, a task number will be generated and will be sent to task queue. 

The video and audio will be extracted with ffmpeg and sent into different models, for video the human face will be detected and a frame will be drawn, 
for audio the english transcript will be extracted generated.

when the process finishes, the status of this task will be marked as finished and the new generated transcript will be available to download

## 2. prequisities

- python3
- ffmpeg
- rabbitmq

## 3. Installation and usage

first, go into app folder

### 3.1 install packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3.2 downlaod model file
Download pretrained model from
https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases/download/v0.8.2/deepspeech-0.8.2-models.tflite

and

https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/blob/master/FaceDetectionComparison/models/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel

and save it into `app/flaskr/models` folder

### 3.3  start rabbitmq
```bash
sudo rabbitmq-server
```

### 3.4 start celery

```bash
celery -A flaskr.task.celery_app worker
```

### 3.5 init the database and run flask

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr 
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask init-db
flask run
```

## 4. Run in docker(recommended)

### 4.1 build the image

```bash
docker-compose build .
```

### 4.2 run the network

```bash
docker-compose up
```

now you can go to visit http://localhost:5000

## 5. screenshots

### 5.1 Main page
After uploading a  video file, a link to task will be present

![upload file](docs/screenshots/1-upload-file.png)

### 5.2 Task pending

The processing will last few minutes

![upload file](docs/screenshots/2-task-pending.png)

Task page will automatically refresh every 30 seconds

### 5.3 Task finished

after task finished, the result transcript as well as generated video will be present and available to download

## 6. To be improved

1. Restriction on the video user could upload
2. Paralleling the workers
3. login and sign in with email validation support
4. notice user when task finishes by email
5. Add upload progress bar
6. Add agree to terms and conditions part
7. Add detailed tutorial
8. Add video preview html part
9. Add GPU acceleration support

## 7. Tips on accelerate the process
1. use ffmpeg command to handle video and audio file, especially remove the silence part of the audio
2. use lightweight pretrained models, load model once only.
3. limits the max video size to be processed
